# How to run

To run this example, simply paste the following commands on your terminal and
then open a browser on "localhost:8000".

(You'll need Poetry for this)

```
git clone git@github.com:Arlaxia/htmx-playground.git
cd htmx-playground/

poetry install
poetry run python manage.py migrate
poetry run python manage.py runserver
```
